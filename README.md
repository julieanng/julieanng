- 👋 Hi, I’m @julieanng
- 👀 I’m interested in almost all the creative arts, (the list is way too long so if it's a creative art, I've probably done it).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (I'm too new to coding to collaborate on anything just yet. But I will in the future!)
- 📫 I can be contacted through my email juicean at yahoo dot com.
